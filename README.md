A distributed system with failover capabilities developed for the Special Topics in Telematics course at EAFIT University.
## ðŸ“¦ Introduction
This repository contains the first project for EAFIT University's Topics in Telematics course, implementing a fault-tolerant microservices system where an API Gateway (FastAPI) handles REST client requests and communicates with gRPC microservices (Sum/Subtraction/Multiplication), automatically failing over to a Redis-based MOM for request queuing during service outages, with Docker Swarm deployment on AWS ensuring high availability.
